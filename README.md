--------------------

latin_square_functions.c - This file contains functions that read in a file that hold a latin square and verify if it is a valid latin square.
  These functions work with pointers and store memory on the heap using malloc instead of using array brackets. There are multiple helper methods 
  to create concise code.
  
Files Written by Others:
--------------------

latin_square_functions.h - This file is a header file that defines the prototypes of the methods to be implemented.
